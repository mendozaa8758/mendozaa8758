Issue #1 Pokemon Team Diversity
The Pokemon teams often only feature a small group of pokemon to pick from. I wanna make this a wider load, maybe about 15-20?
I would use chatgpt to brainstorm more team options and give it some competitive knowledge.
I enjoy competitive Pokémon battles and want to better understand how to create more diverse and effective team
Will probably take a full week?

Issue #2 Lack of creativity with strategies
The teams only had two different strategies it wanted to talk about. Both still ended up using perish song, just with slight changes.
I'll use gemini so I can learn how to use other AI programs.
I think the most fun part of pokemon is getting creative with the tools you're given, and seeing how to make it work.
This should take two weeks.

Issue #3 Adding another priority that the user can input.
Say instead of only allowing you to pick from Trick room or perish trap, you had 6 or 7 different options to pick from. Some examples are weather, hyper offense, and stall teams.
I could use smogon (a competitive pokemon site) and chatgpt to build a reference of what each team consists of. Then it will ask questions to see what team style suits you best.
The different teams you can create, as well as some interaction can make the bot more interesting.
Like I've said, building teams and user convienence are very important for a helpful bot.
This could take a week and a half.
