Champbott Improvement Report
## The single change
I changed it so there is now an alternative pokemon to pick from instead of the original 6.
## Why this change
This change allows for a wider amount of variety in team building for all scenarios. This also allows the bot to have more potential teammembers.
## New test 1 new pokemon for perish trap
There was not enough options.
There was a new mon added, landorous therian.
I would say it was better because it added another option to the limited team

## New Test 2 Sun team
There was a new pokemon added, Rillaboom
It was also better because rillaboom is a viable sun and trick room user.
Change for the better.

## Test Case 3 Mono steel
Not enough variety!
The bot failed to add a pokemon that wasn't already on the team
I would say this is worse.

# Unintended Consequences
One issue I found is that some of the new pokemon would not work super well in the context of the team.
## Still broken (On purpose)
I didn't fix his overexplaining, because it still has its charms, I didn't fix his obsession with perish trap because it is key to his character. I didn't stop him from hating incineroar for the same reason.
## Lesson Learned
Learning about how to improve AI is very hard, it took me longer than expected to do this all.
