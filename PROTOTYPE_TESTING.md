## Version 1: GPT
- ✅ Works: The site looks pretty good, if a bit basic.
- ❌ Broken: The pokemon won't generate, incomplete mode dropdown menu.
- 💭 Observations: It was created with dark mode first (THE BETTER SCREEN MODE BTW)

## Version 2: Gemini
- ✅ Works: Pretty much everything important, it can generate pokemon, EV distribution, as well as create teams for different rulesets.
- ❌ Broken: It hasn't broken so far which is very good for a first try.
- 💭 Observations: Gemini included Emoji's for pictures to better illustrate what some items do.

## Decision
I'm going with Gemini because it created a vastly superior website that actually worked and was able to generate some valid teams.
