1st Prompt
I need you to create a single-page web application based on this PRD:

Project Overview What does it do? (1–2 sentences)

A simple web-based tool that automatically generates competitive Pokémon teams. Users choose a format or style, and the app outputs a balanced 6-Pokémon team instantly. Who is it for? Pokémon players (beginners to intermediate) who struggle with team building or want fast inspiration. What problem does it solve? Competitive team building is difficult, time-consuming, and requires deep knowledge of typings, roles, and synergy. This tool generates usable, balanced teams automatically so players can start battling faster.
Core Features (MVP: 3 features) Feature 1: Team Generation (Core Engine) Description: User selects a team type (e.g., “Balanced,” “Offensive,” “Random”) and the system generates a 6-Pokémon team using pre-defined lists, roles, and type synergy rules. Why it matters: This is the core value: it removes the need for users to manually assemble a viable team. Success criteria: Generates a complete team of 6 Pokémon every time. Ensures no egregious type weaknesses (e.g., 4+ Pokémon weak to the same type). Team includes diverse roles (tank, sweeper, support) when applicable.
Feature 2: Basic Format Selection Description: User can choose between a few preset formats (e.g., Singles OU, VGC Doubles, Random Casual). Each format pulls from its own restricted Pokémon list. Why it matters: Different formats require different sets of Pokémon; this keeps teams relevant and usable. Success criteria: User can switch between at least 2–3 formats. Team generator uses the correct pool for each format.
Feature 3: Export / Copy Team Description: Simple “Copy Team” button that outputs the generated team in a clean text format (e.g., Showdown-compatible text or a readable block). Why it matters: Users need an easy way to copy their team into Pokémon Showdown or save it elsewhere. Success criteria: Single click copies full team text to clipboard. Output is formatted consistently and clearly.
User Experience (UX Flow) What does the user see first? A clean landing page with: Title “Pokémon Team Generator” A dropdown to choose the format A button: “Generate Team” What can they do? Select a format Generate a new team View the generated team list Copy/export the team Click “Generate Again” to refresh Interaction Flow (Step-by-Step) User opens the app and sees a single-page layout with a format dropdown. User selects a format (Balanced, Offensive, OU, VGC, etc.). User clicks Generate Team. The system generates 6 Pokémon based on rules and displays them. User can click Copy Team to copy it to clipboard. User can click Generate Again to regenerate a new team using the same format.
Technical Constraints Single Page Application (SPA) Browser-only client-side logic No server-side or backend required Pokémon data stored in JSON (local file or embedded object) Allowed: React / Vue / Svelte / Vanilla JS (choice up to implementer) State managed client-side only Team generation rules must run entirely in the browser

Out of Scope for V1 (Not Included Yet) Pokémon movesets, EV spreads, or competitive optimization User accounts or saving teams to cloud Real-time type chart visualizations AI-generated custom roles or strategies Full Pokédex search system Backend database or API integrations or dedicated native UI
Online multiplayer or in-app battling
Requirements:
