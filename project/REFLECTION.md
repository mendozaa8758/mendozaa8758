About Your Process:
What was your biggest "aha moment" when working with AI this semester? 
I figured out how to use other ai models besides GPT which is very helpful considering GPT tends to give me bad output.

Describe a time when the AI gave you something useless. What did you do next?
I decided to use another model to give me a better answer, IE gemini for my final team builder.

How did your prompting approach change from Week 1 to now?
I was more specific and less general about my prompts.

About What You Learned:
What's one thing you can do with AI now that you couldn't do in August?
I learned how to create a somewhat functional team building site with ai tools.

What surprised you most about working with AI tools?
There's a lot of information you still need to know to be able to use AI effectively.

What's something AI is genuinely bad at that you discovered firsthand?
Nuance and understanding things that aren't completely black and white, and it also is a bit bad at making it's ownd decisions.

About What's Next:
How might you use AI tools in your other classes or your job?
I could use AI to assist with writing emails or with building a base for my code before I go back and improve with my own knowledge.

What would you tell a friend who's never used AI tools to help them get started?
Don't only use one model! Variety in what your outputs are is very helpful, and gives you higher success odds.

Is there anything you want to learn more about after this course?
What the different AI models excel and struggle with, to figure out which one is best for each prompt.

Honest Assessment:
On a scale of 1-10, how confident do you feel working with AI tools now versus when the semester started? Why?
I feel like I'm on a sturdy 7, I already have begun using AI tools to assist with making something like this, but on a much more basic scale so I feel more confident using it moving forward.
