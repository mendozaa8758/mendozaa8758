What is this?
My project was a pokemon team builder that could give you a basic team to use in a few different formats. 
It also includes what stats to train and their best natures.

What does it do? (Or what was it supposed to do?)
The team builder does exactly what it was meant to do, create basic teams for 3 different types of battles.

How far did you get? (Be honest — "70% there" or "just a prototype" is fine)
I would say I got about 60% of the way done, I could have added movesets and a system to let you know what could counter your team.

What AI tools did you use? (Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.)
I used Gemini for my project.
