## Iteration 1
**Problem**: It would give special type pokemon max attack stats even if they were a special attacker, which reduced their effectiveness.
**Prompt**: For special attackers, modify it so their max physical attack turns into max special attack.
**Result**: The code was succesfully modified, creating physical attackers, special attackers, and walls, (Think a paladin or tank. TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE BABY)
**Status**: ✅ Fixed
## Iteration 2
**Problem**: I kinda wanted to bring in the dark mode from the gpt version.
**Prompt**: Create a dark mode for the website.
**Result**: The site succesfully created the dark mode and even added sun and moon emoji's for a toggle button.
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

## Iteration 3
**Problem**: The Pokemon moods were all the same, which would leave to suboptimal team building. IE, Jolly is only good for fast physical attackers.
**Prompt**: Choose a mood for physical attackers, special attackers, and tanks.
**Result**: THe natures got added succesfully for all the pokemon! lets gooooo!
**Status**: ✅ Fixed
