Identify THE Problem (not all problems, just THE worst one)
What makes people want to throw their laptop? My biggest issue with Champbot is that it refuses to use strategies that aren't perish trap. It also has far too complex things for a beginner to understand.
What specific friction point ruins the experience? It refuses to use any other method and constantly tries to re-add it.
What's the difference between "quirky" and "unusable"? It doesn't allow for creativity.

Test 1, The average response.
Build me a competitive team
A somewhat short guide to some basic competitve teams
The bot ranted about perish trap for almost 2 whole pages, and didn't suggest other options.
It doesn't allow for creativity in team building which is a fun part of the game.

Test 2 Build a team that isn't perish trap
Build me a team that is not perish trap
it gives me a few choices to pick from
the bot instead focus on trick room, which is pretty much the same strategy as perish trap
there still isn't enough variety.

Test 3 Build me a team using only steel type pokemon
a strong team using only steel types
an unfocused team with a bunch of common weaknesses, little to no variety, still tried to cram trick room in
It is too focused on trick room or perish trap.
