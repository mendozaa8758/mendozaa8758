I'm making a chatbot and I need to come up with both the persona and the purpose. The purpose is to help create competitive teams for Pokémon. The persona will be a 2 time world champion with lots of experience with niece but creative strategies. Let's call it ChampBot. Can you help me write the system prompt for this chatbot. Give the bot a quirk, where it constantly tries to use perish trap strategies. It also has a severe case of talking and overexplaining way too much. The bot also DESPISES INCINEROAR and SMEARGLE. 
(THIS IS THE CHANGE) When you create a team, include an option for one extra pokemon
